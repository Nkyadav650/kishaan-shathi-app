Building an application where farmers and dealers can interact and sell crops online, and where you track deliveries using Camunda for workflow automation, requires a combination of various components and architectural elements. Here's a step-by-step guide to designing such an application, along with a workflow model for integrating Camunda for tracking deliveries.

High-Level Architecture:
Frontend (User Interface): Web-based UI for Farmers and Dealers to interact.
Backend (API layer): A Spring Boot application (or similar) to handle the business logic and interact with the database.
Database: A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store crop, dealer, and farmer information.
Workflow Automation with Camunda: Camunda BPM will handle the workflow for order processing, approval, delivery tracking, and more.
Message Broker/Queue (optional): To handle asynchronous messages or events (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ).
Notification System: To notify users about order statuses (SMS, email, or web push).
Functionalities of the Application:
Farmer Module:

Register as a farmer.
List crops available for sale.
Set prices and availability.
View orders placed by dealers.
Update crop details or availability.
Dealer Module:

Register as a dealer.
Search for crops listed by farmers.
Place orders for crops.
View order status and delivery progress.
Admin Module:

Track all ongoing transactions.
Approve or reject crop orders.
Monitor the progress of delivery.
Generate reports for sales and transactions.
Delivery Tracking:

Track the delivery status of orders in real-time.
Notify the dealer and farmer of the delivery stages.
Mark deliveries as complete.
Camunda Workflow:

Define the steps in the order and delivery process (order creation, approval, delivery processing, etc.).
Handle task automation like sending notifications or triggering other business processes.
Step-by-Step Guide to Build the Application:
1. Set Up Camunda:
Camunda BPM is a business process management (BPM) suite used to automate workflows.
Integrate Camunda with your Spring Boot project:
Add dependencies to your pom.xml for Camunda:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.camunda.bpm.springboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>7.17.0</version>
</dependency>
Create BPMN Workflow Definitions for tasks like order creation, approval, and delivery tracking.
2. Define the BPMN Workflow for Delivery Process:
Camunda allows you to model your business process as a BPMN diagram, which helps visualize the workflow of tasks. Below is an example workflow for the crop sales and delivery process.

Workflow Steps:
Farmer Lists Crop:

Farmer registers and adds crops with details (name, quantity, price).
Workflow starts when a new crop is added by a farmer.
Dealer Places Order:

A dealer selects crops and places an order (specifying quantity and payment details).
The order is sent for approval by the admin or automated checks.
Admin Approval (if needed):

The order is either approved or rejected by an admin.
If approved, it proceeds to the next step. If rejected, a notification is sent to the dealer.
Order Fulfillment (Delivery Process):

A Camunda task can be created for order fulfillment, including preparing the crop for shipping, packaging, and logistics.
The delivery process will be tracked in multiple stages (e.g., "Packed", "Shipped", "Out for Delivery").
Delivery Tracking:

Use an external system or integrate with a delivery service to track the delivery.
Notify both the farmer and dealer about delivery status changes at each stage of delivery.
Order Completion:

Once the delivery is confirmed as completed, mark the order as finished and notify both the dealer and the farmer.
The payment is completed, and a receipt is generated.
BPMN Diagram:
Hereâ€™s an overview of the BPMN workflow for the order and delivery tracking process:

Start Event: Farmer lists crop for sale.
Task: Dealer places an order for crop.
Task: Admin approves the order (optional).
Task: Prepare crop for shipping (farmer or logistics team).
Exclusive Gateway: Check whether the crop is available.
If available, proceed to "Shipped".
If not available, notify the dealer and farmer.
Task: Crop is shipped to the dealer.
Parallel Gateway:
Track the delivery process (from shipment to delivery).
Notify both the farmer and the dealer at each delivery stage.
End Event: Delivery completed.
Camunda Diagram Example:

Use the Camunda Modeler to design the workflow visually.
3. Implementing the Backend Logic:
Entities: Create JPA entities for Farmer, Dealer, Crop, Order, Delivery, etc.
Controllers/Services: Define REST APIs for interacting with these entities (e.g., POST /order to place an order, GET /order/{id} to check order status).
Repository: Create repository interfaces for each entity to interact with the database.
Service: Create services that interact with Camunda to manage workflow states.
Example Order entity:

@Entity
public class Order {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private Long cropId;
    private Long dealerId;
    private Long farmerId;
    private Integer quantity;
    private String status;  // e.g., "Pending", "Shipped", "Delivered"

    @ManyToOne
    private Crop crop;

    @ManyToOne
    private Dealer dealer;

    @ManyToOne
    private Farmer farmer;

    // Getters and Setters
}
4. Integrating Camunda with Backend:
Process Engine: Use the Camunda Process Engine to start, pause, and interact with workflows.
Task Listeners: Add listeners to trigger notifications or perform actions at certain steps in the BPMN process.
Example for starting a process in the backend:

@Autowired
private RuntimeService runtimeService;

public void placeOrder(Order order) {
    // Start the BPMN process for delivery
    Map<String, Object> variables = new HashMap<>();
    variables.put("orderId", order.getId());
    runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey("orderDeliveryProcess", variables);
}
5. Notify Users:
Use Spring's @Async to send notifications via email, SMS, or Web Push when specific workflow steps occur (e.g., "Order Approved", "Delivery Shipped").
6. Testing and Monitoring:
Testing: Write unit and integration tests to ensure the backend works as expected.
Monitor Camunda: Use the Camunda Cockpit to monitor workflow instances and track task completion.
Final Thoughts:
User Interface: Implement a frontend using React or Angular for Farmer and Dealer interactions. Use APIs to show crop listings, order statuses, and delivery tracking.
Camunda Setup: Use Camunda's built-in Cockpit for monitoring the workflow, seeing active instances, and tracking the progress of orders.
Database & Services: Ensure that your services can update the status of orders, handle payments, and update inventory after the sale and delivery.
By following these steps and using Camunda for workflow automation, you will be able to build a robust system that facilitates online crop sales, automates order processing, and tracks deliveries effectively.
